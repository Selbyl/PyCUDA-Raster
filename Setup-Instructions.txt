This is a fork of the original repo to port to Python 3.10. This has been tested on Ubuntu 24.10 with a Nvidia P40 and confirmed works with DEM.tif files from Copernicus.

Currently experimenting with running batches to leverage multiple CPU cores and available VRAM. 

to run multiple files: 

cd to you source DEM.tif files.

parallel -j XX \
  'out="location/of/output{/.}_hillshade.tif"; \ 
   ROWS_MAX=3600 python3 /location/to/scheduler.py \
     {} "$out" hillshade' \
  ::: *.tif
